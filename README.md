Reproducibility Instructions:

1) Envionments

Clone this repo and then clone OpenBTE. In the future clone Matinverse.

Two separate environments are provided above. 
-> requirements_bte.txt allows to run OpenBTE MFP Bolztmann Solver, to validate our designs and to run the Bayesian Optimization (BO) baseline.
-> requirements_peds.txt allows to run all experiments regarding peds, including the active learning and the optimization using peds and the other surrogates



2) Running the code

(Matinverse not being yet released)
